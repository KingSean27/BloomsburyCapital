Basic:
- Use the data sets provided to generate the price today of all the stocks pitched in 17-18 & 18-19

Next Steps: 
- Price in local currency leaves out a lot of valuble data about returns, find the total dividends and returns in GBP for each stock

Further Challenges:
- Which of these stocks have returned alpha against their benchmark?
- Which associates have pitched the best stocks?
- Which stocks have had the least volatility?
- Compare comps between some of the data sets 
- Which stocks have given the best time adjusted returns

Remember it's an open ended project so do anything you want to do with the data and you think might be of interest!
