Basic:
- Use the data sets provided to generate the price today of all the stocks pitched in 17-18 & 18-19

Next Steps: 
- Price in local currency leaves out a lot of valuble data about returns, find the total dividends and returns in GBP for each stock

Further Challenges:
- Which of these stocks have returned alpha against their benchmark?
- Which associates have pitched the best stocks?
- Which stocks have had the least volatility?
- Compare comps between some of the data sets 
- Model an ideal portfolio

Remember it's an open ended project so do anything you want to do with the data and you think might be of interest!
